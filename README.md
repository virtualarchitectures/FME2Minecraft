# FME2Minecraft
FME workspaces for translating geographic information to Minecraft

## Why use FME?
FME allows Mincraft levels to be read as Pointclouds. Standard pointcloud tools such as the PointCloudMerger can then be used to analyse Minecraft levels e.g. to identify changes over time. FME also provides tools to sample geographic information and 3D geometry at regular intervals (one point per metre) as poinclouds that can then be styled as Minecraft blocks and loaded into the game.
